#### Insertion Sort Project

Insertion Sort Steps:

Step 1: [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]

Step 2: [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]  

Step 3: [16, 22, 27, 2, 18, 6]   

Step 4: [2, 16, 22, 27, 18, 6]  

Step 5: [2, 16, 18, 22, 27, 6]

Step 6: [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]

Big-O Notation: The time complexity of Insertion Sort is O(n^2).

Time Complexity:

Average Case:  In the average case, the probability of 18 being in the middle is high, so, we can call this as average case.

Worst Case: Represents the scenario where 18 is at the end of the array.

Best Case: Represents the scenario where 18 is at the beginning of the array.

First Fourth Steps of Selection Sort Steps:

Step 1: [2, 3, 5, 8, 7, 9, 4, 15, 6]

Step 2: [2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9, 5, 15, 6]

Step 3: [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 8, 15, 6]

Step 4: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 8, 15, 7]
