## My Projects

### <p align="center">Insertion Sort Project</p>

Insertion Sort Steps:

Step 1: [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]

Step 2: [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]  

Step 3: [16, 22, 27, 2, 18, 6]   

Step 4: [2, 16, 22, 27, 18, 6]  

Step 5: [2, 16, 18, 22, 27, 6]

Step 6: [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]

Big-O Notation: The time complexity of Insertion Sort is O(n^2).

Time Complexity:

Average Case:  In the average case, the probability of 18 being in the middle is high, so, we can call this as average case.

Worst Case: Represents the scenario where 18 is at the end of the array.

Best Case: Represents the scenario where 18 is at the beginning of the array.

First Fourth Steps of Selection Sort Steps:

Step 1: [2, 3, 5, 8, 7, 9, 4, 15, 6]

Step 2: [2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9, 5, 15, 6]

Step 3: [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 8, 15, 6]

Step 4: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 8, 15, 7]




### <p align="center">Merge Sort Project</p>

Merge Sort Steps:

Step 1: [16, 21, 11, 8, 12, 22]

Step 2: [16, 21, 11]   [8, 12, 22]   

Step 3: [16]   [21, 11]   [8]   [12, 22]  

Step 4: [16]   [11, 21]   [8]   [12, 22]  

Step 5: [11, 16, 21]   [8, 12, 22]   

Step 6: [8, 11, 12, 16, 21, 22]  

Big-O Notation: The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n).




### <p align="center">Binary Search Tree Project </p>

Binary Search Tree Construction Steps: 

Step 1: Insert 7 (Root: 7)

Step 2: Insert 5 (Left of 7 -> 5)

Step 3: Insert 1 (Left of 5 -> 1)

Step 4: Insert 8 (Right of 7 -> 8)

Step 5: Insert 3 (Right of 1 -> 3)

Step 6: Insert 6 (Right of 5 -> 6)

Step 7: Insert 0 (Left of 1 -> 0)

Step 8: Insert 9 (Right of 8 -> 9)

Step 9: Insert 4 (Right of 3 -> 4)

Step 10: Insert 2 (Right of 1 and Left of 3 -> 2)
